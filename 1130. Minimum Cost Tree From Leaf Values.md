## Solution 1

Essentially, we get rid of an element at the cost of (current element) * (the next greater element, on left or right).  
To get the minimal cost, we want the larger element be as small as possible, so we pick the next greater element, on left or right.  

Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(n)  

```java
class Solution {
    public int mctFromLeafValues(int[] arr) {
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        int min = 0;
        stack.push(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        
        for (int i : arr) {
            while (stack.peek() < i) {
                int mid = stack.pop();
                min += mid * Math.min(stack.peek(), i);
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }
        while (stack.size() > 2) {
            min += stack.pop() * stack.peek();
        }
        return min;
    }
}
