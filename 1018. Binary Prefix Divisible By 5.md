## Solution 1
This question is similar to question 1015.  Assume we have the numer 0111, then we will check 0, 01, 011, 0111. For each number, we can carry the result to the next one through mod calculations, so we don't need to calculate the entire number again and again.  

The induction rule is `next = pre * 2 + lastBit`, for example, `0111 = 011 * 2 + 1`. Here's the prove:  
```
011  = 2^2 * 0 + 2^1 * 1 + 2^0 * 1 = 3
0111 = 011 * 2 + 2^0 * 1 (the extra bit added at the end, either 0 or 1) 
     = (2^2 * 0 + 2^1 * 1 + 2^0 * 1) * 2 + 2^0 * 1
     = 2^3 * 0 + 2^2 * 1 + 2^1 * 1 + 2^0 * 1
     = 7
```
Since we always append the extra digit (0 or 1) at the end, which is multiplied by 2^0 = 1. Because multiplying by one could be ignored, we will simply add the extra digit at the end. Eventually, we have `next = pre * 2 + lastBit`.  

Next, we need to record the remainder of the number rather than the whole number, which will overflow quickly. Here's how:

In general, we know that `(a + b) % k = (a % k + b % k ) % k` and in this question, we already get `next = pre * 2 + bit`.  

First we assume:  
```
n % k = r
n = m * k + r; 
```
then we can have:  
```
2n + lastBit = 2(mk + r) + lastBit
2n + lastBit = 2mk + 2r + lastBit; 
(2n + lastBit) % k = (2r + lastBit) % k;
```
Therefore we know that calculation based on the number itself, `n`, and it's remainder, `r`, is the same. In other words, we don't have to do `next = pre * 2 + bit`, but rather `remainderOfNext = remainderOfPre * 2 + bit`

Time complexity: O(n)  
Space complexity: O(1)  

```java
class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> prefixesDivBy5(int[] A) {
        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int r = 0;
        for (int bit : A) {
            r = (r * 2 + bit) % 5;
            result.add(r % 5 == 0);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
